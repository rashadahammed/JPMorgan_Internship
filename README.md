It have 4 Project

# Project 1:

**About data cleaning**

First, familiarize yourself with Excel’s conditional formatting tools by watching the introductory videos using the links provided in Additional Resources. If you are already comfortable with how to use conditional formatting, feel free to refresh your memory with the videos or move on to the exercise.  Then, use the conditional formatting tools to do the following explorations of the data:

Highlight any cells with formula errors in purple with white text.
Highlight any cells with missing values in yellow.
Identify accounts that have not been cross-sold with Product 2 by highlighting the appropriate Product 2 cells in orange.
Identify accounts that have a 5-year sales CAGR of at least 100% by highlighting the appropriate CAGR cells in green and any accounts with a negative CAGR in red with white text.
Identify accounts in the top 10% of unit sales for 2021 by highlighting the appropriate 2021 unit sales cells in blue.

# Project 2:

**Macro**

You will create two macros and associated buttons:

A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 5 YR CAGR in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall 5-year sales growth.
A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 2021 unit sales in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall unit sales in 2021.

# Project 3:

**About Charts and Dashboards**

Your task is to create a simple dashboard using the account sales dataset you worked with in prior tasks. A clean copy of that spreadsheet is available in Additional Resources below.Then, consider your dataset. What charts and graphs would be useful related to this data? Unit sales by year? Top 10 accounts by unit sales or CAGR? Effectiveness of different marketing programs by the number of sales driven? Sales by account type? There are a variety of different ways you could gain insight from this dataset. Pick the ones you find most compelling, and use those to create your dashboard.

# Project 4:

**About PowerPoint Making**

write your presentation using the template found in Additional Resources below.  Feel free to add slides to the template if needed, but remember: clear, concise, and compelling. Shorter is almost always better. In no more than 3-5 slides,

Write a compelling title to grab the attention of your audience.
Convey a key, overarching point using a compelling visual you find online to further grab your reader’s attention. Just copy and paste a photo that you find online; no need for original artwork.
Communicate key points and ideas about your account sales analysis, including sales performance (or lack thereof), opportunities for improvement or operational focus, and any other points you think tell a good data-driven story.
Make a recommendation for an action that your audience should take as a result of your analysis of account sales.
